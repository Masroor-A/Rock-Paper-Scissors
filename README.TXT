This Program starts by asking which move you want to play:

R - Rock
P - Paper 
S - Scissors 
Q - Quit 

once you select your move the program will chose a random move aswell and will display a visual of both moves and will display text saying who won

once you select quit the program will display how many wins, losses and ties you got.
